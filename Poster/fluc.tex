We can write a system of stochastic differential equations
as
\[
dX=\mu(X,t)dt+\Gamma(X,t)dW_{t},
\]
Take the Jacobian of the deterministic system around a steady state $X_{ss}$ to get
\[
dX=J_{\mu}(X_{ss},t)dt+\Gamma(X_{ss},t)dW_{t}.
\]
The Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem states that the variance-covariance matrix, $\Sigma$, can be found using the formula
\[
J_{\mu}(X_{ss},t)\Sigma(X_{ss},t)+\Sigma(X_{ss},t)J_{\mu}^{T}(X_{ss},t)=-\Gamma^{2}(X_{ss},t).
\]
